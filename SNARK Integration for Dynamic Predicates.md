SNARK Integration for Dynamic Predicates: How can we design the system (smart contracts, off-chain logic) to allow petitioners to specify dynamic predicate requirements (e.g., age > N, specific department list) for their petition, and how can signers generate SNARK proofs satisfying these specific, potentially unique, requirements?
SNARK Choice & Circuit Design: What SNARK schemes (Groth16, PLONK, etc.) are suitable, considering trade-offs like setup needs, proof size, and on-chain verification cost? How should the SNARK circuit be designed to incorporate both the dynamic predicate logic and the necessary links back to the DTRAC credential validity?
Optimizing On-Chain Costs (Verifier Deployment): Given that dynamic predicates might imply many different SNARK circuits, how can we avoid deploying a unique verifier contract (and incurring high gas costs) for every single petition or predicate variant? Are there techniques like recursive proofs, universal circuits, or other optimizations?
Interaction with Existing DTRAC Proofs: Can the introduction of SNARKs for predicate verification allow us to simplify or eliminate any of the existing DTRAC ZKPoKs (specifically πs​ for issuance or πv​ for verification)? What are the implications for the overall proof structure and data flow?
System Architecture Changes: What modifications are required to the overall system architecture (e.g., PetitionContract.sol, User.py, interaction flow) to support this dynamic predicate SNARK system?

Okay Now let's try to build the earlier system that we discussed, what are teh approaches we could take then ? , What would the ZKP look like?, how do we break it down into sigma protocols, Remember that We have existing ZKPOKs, that maybe could help?, I am still not sure how they are implemented, but if I truly want a "privacy" preserving petition system
